# SimpleRESTClient
This is a simple HTTP REST web Client.

Postman (desktop app) in comparison takes 600 Mo in my RAM, whereas this Client takes 25 Mo in a Chrome tab. It seems that Postman
Chrome extensions are no longer available, I wanted something light and didn't find it, so I thought I could create it, also as an
exercise of code.
